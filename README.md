# Pixel Art Maker Project with JavaScript

I made this exercise with Javascript only.
It was tottaly different than JQuery, because the selectors have different workings.
At the end of the day, all I needed was in the lesson!
Read the comments, so you know what I mean.
It was good practice after all!
I did this with lots of help from Nicolas Marcora (as always lately, so thanks man!!!)
